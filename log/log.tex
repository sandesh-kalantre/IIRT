 \item \texttt{14th February 2015 \\ Sandesh Kalantre, Kumar Ayush \\}
 We went to Lemington road in the morning and brought the following items which will
 be used in the preliminary stage of the project.
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
   \hline
   \textbf{Item} & \textbf{Cost(\rupee)} \\
   \hline
   $60$cm Radio Dish with the mount & 450 \\
   \hline
   LNB(Low noise block) & 350 \\
   \hline
   Satellite Finder & 200 \\
   \hline 
   Co-axial cable RG-$6$ ($1$ m) & - \\
   \hline
   \textbf{Total} & 1000 \\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
  The items were purchased from \textit{Ravi Enterprises} for a total cost of \rupee 1000.The amount was split
  equally between Sandesh and Ayush.
  
  \textbf{Note:} We had planned to get a dish of size $\sim 1$m.However,it seems that such a dish is not commercially available and
  hence the $60cm$ standard dish for DTH-TV connections was purchased.
