 We went to Lamington road in the morning and brought the following items which will
 be used in the preliminary stage of the project.
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
   \hline
   \textbf{Item} & \textbf{Cost(\rupee)} \\
   \hline
   $60$cm Radio Dish with the mount & 450 \\
   \hline
   LNB(Low noise block) & 350 \\
   \hline
   Satellite Finder & 200 \\
   \hline 
   Co-axial cable RG-$6$ ($1$ m) & - \\
   \hline
   \textbf{Total} & 1000 \\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
  The items were purchased from \textit{Ravi Enterprises} for a total cost of \rupee 1000.The amount was split
  equally between Sandesh and Ayush.
  
  \textbf{Note:} We had planned to get a dish of size $\sim 1$m.However,it seems that such a dish is not commercially available and
  hence the $60cm$ standard dish for DTH-TV connections was purchased.

  \item \texttt{28th February 2015 \\ Sandesh Kalantre, Kumar Ayush, Raj Kedia \\ }
  We assembled the dish and LNB arm.It seems that we will have to build a system for the azimuthal mount.We could
  not get the satellite finder to work with the assembled dish as it seemed we needed a receiver to draw power for
  the satellite finder.
  
  \item \texttt{4th March 2015 \\ Sandesh Kalantre, Kumar Ayush, Alankar Kotwal \\}
  We started with a meeting in TL in which we discussed on the possible mode of operation of the satellite finder.
  We decided to test the satellite finder using a function generator but we lacked the required \textbf{Type F} connectors.
  Also we discovered that the LNB input and receiver output terminals are just shorted so using the satellite finder as a receiver may
  not be feasible.
  
  \textbf{To do:}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Buy \textbf{Type F} connector 
   \item See a basic demo of the proposed idea from Anchal Gupta
   \item Enquire IITD group about their receiver system
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
